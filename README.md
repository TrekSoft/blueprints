# Blueprint Measuring Tool

## Functionality

Whipped this up over the weekend with the following functionality:
* Search for different floor plan blueprints from Google images
* Select one
* Click the measuring tool to start calibration
* Measure a known distance on the blueprint
* Calibrate it from the drawing
* Now measure anything you want (after making a measurement, click anywhere to start over)

## Get Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Opportunities for Improvement
* No Typescript
* Raw CSS (would instead use SCSS with common variables or the JoyUI theming functionality)
* No Unit Tests
